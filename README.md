Over the last decade or more I have been working with all things geospatial applications, teaching, training and acting as a translator at large for technology needs. I am a Senior Product Manager at MAXAR incharge of building the Developer Relations team and core APIs. I am the creator of Awesome Google Earth Engine Community Catalog. I am also an affiliate Faculty at University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa and Designated Campus Colleague at the University of Arizona. I advocate for science communication, serve as a thought leader, and teach geospatial applications. I believe in fostering community and commons-based data, tools, and platforms for mutual benefit. My research delves into big data analysis and geospatial technology's applications, while championing open data access. A passionate community advocate, and a speaker I like to drive ideas.
