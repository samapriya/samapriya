Over the last decade or more I have been working with all things geospatial applications, teaching, training and acting as a translator at large for technology needs. I believe data, tools, and platforms can benefit from each other if built around community and commons. 🌎My research interest has included big data analysis and large scale data science applications utilizing geospatial technology. I am passionate about satellite imagery, geospatial data, and data access at large and on how to make its use and implementation as openly available as possible. I am a community advocate and love to drive thought.
